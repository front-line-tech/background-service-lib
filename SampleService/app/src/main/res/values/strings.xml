        This app manages an ongoing Service that runs with a notification to help Android
        prioritise it highly enough to keep it operational in the background.
        \n\nThere are two background services running: the DemonstrationBindingService (to which this
        Activity is bound), and the DemonstrationMessagingService which can receive inter-process
        messages from other apps (although in this case you will be sending messages from the same
        process).
